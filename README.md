Racket Theme for Brackets
===========================

> The Racket theme is not a theme for the faint of heart.

It is intended for the decisive programmer and/or markup specialist who knows exactly what they want and how they want it.
With that said, Racket is not an end to your text editor's visuals, it is only the beginning. Take Racket and mold it to your personal style. Don't be shy here, after all, it's just CSS.

# How to use Racket

It is recommended that you use Racket with the [themes-for-brackets](https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets) extension by Jacse.

1. Open your *"Extension Manager"* under the > File menu.
2. Click on the Install from URL button located at the bottom left of the modal.
3. Paste in <https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets> then click the install button. The install should now be completed.
4. Go to the > Help menu and select *"Show Extensions Folder."*
5. Navigate to *extensions/user/themesforbrackets/themes/* and move the racket.css file to the directory.
6. Refresh Brackets (Cmd + R) on your Mac, or F5 on Windows.
7. Go to the newly created > Themes menu and select Racket from the dropdown.

Racket should now be loaded as your main theme. Enjoy.

# Why is it called Racket?

The naming of the Racket theme was considered solely based on the fact that it rhymes with Brackets. No other influences were factored in.

# In closing

Racket offers a frustration-free environment for you to author some of the best code you've ever conceived. It stays out of your way while allowing you to focus on what really matters.

Look at all that beautiful code!
