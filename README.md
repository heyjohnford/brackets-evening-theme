Evening Theme for Brackets
===========================

> The Evening theme is not a theme for the faint of heart.

It is intended for the decisive programmer and/or markup specialist who knows exactly what they want and how they want it.
With that said, Evening is not an end to your text editor's visuals, it is only the beginning. Take Evening and mold it to your personal style.

# Why is it called Evening?

It's named "Evening" as an attempt to pay respect to the "Tomorrow Night" color scheme from which it was derived.
